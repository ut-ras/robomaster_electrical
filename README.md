# RoboMaster Electrical
Welcome to Stampede's Electrical Team repository!

Our team is tasked with designing and interfacing the hardware that brings our robots to life, and this repo contains all design files relevant to developing these systems.
Please read the [Wiki]( https://github.com/ut-ras/robomaster_electrical/wiki) for onboarding information and our active projects.

## Workflow

<ins>**Do not clone this repository**</ins> if you are working on one of the projects in the listed directories!.\
Instead, click on the submodule (directory) for the project you want to work on to be sent to its dedicated repository, then clone using the green `<> Code` button.

This repository is meant only for organization and working on the master schematics. You may update the project submodules using `update.sh`\
This will discard all changes in the submodule directories and get the latest `main` commit for each project.
